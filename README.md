# Animal Shelter Outcomes

Several years ago Kaggle released a competition related to [animal shelter outcomes](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/overview). The goal of the competition was to determine if the Austin Animal Shelter (AAC) could reasonably predict the outcome (death, adoption, transfer to another facility, etc.) of a pet brought to their shelter.

Having volunteered at AAC in the past, I took an initial stab at analyzing the data in Python. Several years later I revisited the data and performed a similar analysis in R as part of my Master's program. Attached is the code for both analyses - they are not meant to be exact copies but rather separate stand-alone entities. The raw data used can be found on Kaggle's [website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/data).
